# O'Watch.ID: The People's Media Protocol

### Watch-to-Earn. For Real This Time.

Tired of giving away your time and attention for free? So are we.

O'Watch.ID isn't just another crypto project—it's a rebellion. We're building a decentralized media platform where you're not the product; you're the owner. We've seen projects before us fail by becoming Ponzi schemes. We're different. We're built on a clear, transparent, and sustainable model that puts the power (and the profit) back in your hands.

## The Core Concept: How It Works

This isn't some magic-money trick. Our entire ecosystem is fueled by real-world revenue, and we've designed a simple, unbreakable rule: 

1.  **Advertisers Pay Us:** Brands pay to place their video ads on the O'Watch.ID platform. This is our sole revenue stream.
2.  **The Smart Contract Takes Over:** All of this ad revenue goes directly into a public smart contract on the Base blockchain.
3. Users earn OWT Tokens (O’Watch Tokens) after watching video ads for a certain duration or completing daily missions (e.g., watching 5 ads). Goal: Drive Daily Active Users (DAU) and retention.
4. Creators receive a higher percentage of their repurchased tokens (80%) based on engagement (views, likes, shares) and W2E metrics. Goal: Attract and retain quality content creators.

No new user funds. No hidden fees. Just a transparent, self-sustaining loop.

## Our Roadmap & What's Next

This is just the beginning.

* **Phase 1: The Core Protocol.** We're focused on perfecting the smart contract and building the base UI.
* **Phase 2: Creator & Community Tools.** We'll introduce creator dashboards, NFT integration for special content, and a comprehensive user profile system.
* **Phase 3: The DAO.** The ultimate goal is to hand over governance to the community. Token holders will be able to vote on key decisions, from platform fees to new features.
